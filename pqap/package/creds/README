The CA certificate ca.crt is a placeholder, you must replace it with a CA
certificate created for your OpenVPN network.  See the [instructions from
OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/documentation/howto.html#pki)
for creating RSA-signed certificates, or `openvpn/config/picnic-pki.md` for
Picnic-signed certificates.  Using Picnic certificates provides post-quantum
security for authentication as well.
